# ChatBox
PHP project for a simple dynamic ChatBox.
I have used HTML, PHP and MySQL in this project.
It outputs a chat forum like webpage in which one can insert messages.
Data entered by user will be stored in the database table.
There is an SQL folder in which database is provided, I want to add some more features in the project in coming days.
